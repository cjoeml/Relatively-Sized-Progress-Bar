## Purpose & Goals

Its function is to change the size of the progress bar that is relative to the terminal's current window size. I also wanted to create a progress bar without any bloated functionality. The progress bar is just a progress bar and nothing else. Its very basic functionality should allow for previous Python versions to encounter no real issues. 

## Usage & Installation

See testing. Since this is a very simple implementation of a progress bar, either move the function into the desired .py file or import directly from ProgressBar.py. 

## Requirements

This progress bar implementation keeps vanilla Python requirements in mind. No external libraries are used. The dependencies are listed below:
```
os
sys
time
struct
platform
subprocess
```
